# How do I intend to tackle jQuery?

  Well, I've already done some Codecademy on it
  So, now I want to do it with an actual webpage (not Codecademy's virtual browser thing)

  This means that I will have to research how to actually require jQuery
    and run it on my computer
  To research this, I can look at the jQuery docs, and Stack Overflow

  If I am going to spend two straight hors on this, I will probably
  want to take a break every 20 - 30 minutes or so

  What I want to get out of this is how to use JavaScript functions
  that I already know from previously and apply them to jQuery so that
  I can have dynamic pages that do things that look interesting to the user


# Project:

  Daily checklist
    -input text and js assigns it to somewhere on a grid,
    corresponding with the time of day that you're doing it at
    (up to 30 min accuracy)
      range: from 5:00 am to 9:00 pm
    -allow user to check things off of the list
    -user can toggle the color of list background to denote the length of time for each thing

# What to research???

-Need a refresher on HTML grids
-I need to relearn a few things on forms and drop down menus
-How to assign the user's input from the form to a position on the page?
-How exactly is the check box feature going to work?
