# the database in some way -- maybe for students who have a
# certain first name, or some other attribute. If you like,
# you can simply modify the home page to take a query parameter,
# and filter the students displayed if a query parameter is present.

# This seraches for students by campus as a query parameter on the homepage:
# name with spaces have to be interspersed with %20:
# i.e. http://localhost:9393/?name=Dandre%20Wiegand

# Responses to prompts at end of challenge:

# Is Sinatra the only web app library in Ruby? What are some others?

# It was a bit hard to find libraries - as opposed to frameworks,
# but I found Rails (of course), lotus, and volt as other ones

# Are SQLite and the sqlite3 gem your only options for using a database with Sinatra? What are some others?

# No, there are also activerecord and datamapper for Sinatra apps

# What is meant by the term web stack?

# It looks like this refers to the combination of web technologies, languages,
# operating systems, and databases used in combination to make
# web applications
